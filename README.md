Impact of COVID-19 on Worldwide Aviation - project datasets and code

 - Code to reproduce results in Section II can be found in `section_2_impact.Rmd` and `section_2_impact.ipynb` (Section II-A/B/C/D/F can be found in the Rmd file, Section II-E in the Jupyter Notebook).

 - Code to reproduce results in Section IV can be found in `section_4_forecast.Rmd`.

 - To run the Rmd files, download all the csv files (these are cleaned data sets) on this page and put them in the same directory as your Rmd files.

 - To run the Jupyter Notebook, you need to follow the instruction (at the beginning of the notebook) and download the OpenSky raw data yourself. You will also need the files in the folder `ICAO_table`.
